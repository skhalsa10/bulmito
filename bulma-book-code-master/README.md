# Creating Interfaces with Bulma

![Bulma](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51AJvfHelgL._SX260_.jpg)

This repo contains sample code for the book, "Creating Interfaces with Bulma," by [Bleeding Edge Press](https://bleedingedgepress.com). The book is a step-by-step guide to building a web interface from scratch and can be purchased [here](https://bleedingedgepress.com/creating-interfaces-bulma/).

The example website that you will build is an administration interface for an online book publisher, where users can log in to manage three content types: Books, Customers, and Orders. This interface has been chosen because it satisfies all of the requirements for common CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) functionalities, which exist in any type of website or CMS.
